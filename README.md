# Traffic-road-accident-analysis-in-the-UK
This project developed an interactive dashboard-driven data analytics analyzing over 300, 300,000 road traffic accidents across the UK using Excel. The project utilized descriptive statistics and visual analytics in Excel to examine traffic accident trends, identified high-risk conditions, and propose evidence-based interventions for road safety
# Aim
To utilise descriptive statistics and visual analytics in Excel to examine traffic accident trends, identify high-risk conditions, and propose evidence-based interventions for improving road safety in the UK.
# Objectives
•	Clean and preprocess a large dataset of UK road accidents.
•	Investigate patterns in accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors such as road condition, lighting, weather, speed, and time of day.
•	Develop an interactive Excel dashboard to provide dynamic insights for stakeholders.
•	Deliver data-driven recommendations for enhancing road safety policies and infrastructure.
# Introduction
Road traffic accidents remain a significant public safety and infrastructure challenge. Every year, they result in thousands of fatalities, injuries, and disruptions across the UK. Data-driven approaches enable stakeholders to understand accident patterns and develop targeted interventions. This project, delivered through CoreTech Labs, utilises a real-world dataset to generate insights through data cleaning, statistical analysis, and dashboard visualisation.
# Problem Statement
Despite the availability of detailed accident records, raw data is often unstructured and inconsistent. Consequently:
•	Stakeholders find it difficult to assess accident severity trends and risk factors.
•	Policy decisions and resource allocation lack empirical support.
•	Public safety measures tend to be reactive rather than proactive.
This project focused on addressing these issues by transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Rationale for the Project
•	Strategic Intervention: Identifying risk factors specific to time, location, and conditions.
•	Cost- Effectiveness: Prioritising resource distribution based on empirical trends.
•	Public Awareness: Highlighting seasonal and regional accident patterns.
•	Policy Support: Informing speed limits, road maintenance, and traffic control planning.
# Rationale 
Road traffic accidents remain a significant public safety issue in the UK, leading to thousands of injuries and deaths each year. Although extensive accident data is collected, much of it remains underused due to inconsistent formats and a lack of visual analysis. This project addresses that gap by converting raw traffic accident records into clean, structured data and creating an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and risk factors. By examining variables such as weather, lighting, speed, and road type, it helps identify the conditions most linked to severe accidents. The results support data-driven decision-making, allowing authorities to target high-risk areas, allocate resources effectively, and develop safer road designs and policies. Ultimately, the project bridges the gap between complex datasets and actionable road safety insights, contributing to smarter, safer communities.
# Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard offers compelling visualisations of key accident parameters: Overall Summaries displaying total accidents and trends over years; accident severity classifications (fatal, serious, slight); time- based analyses (morning, afternoon, evening); environmental conditions (good weather, daylight); road surface conditions (dry, normal, wet, snow); road and traffic factors (dry roads, single carriageways, high speeds); and geospatial distribution (mapped accident rates across the top 20 districts).
Analytical Methods employed: Data Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics, and Visualisations.

# Recommendations
Based on the insights, several interventions and recommendations were proposed.
# Tools Used
•	Microsoft Excel: Data processing, PivotTables, charts, and slicers
•	Data Visualization: KPI design, geospatial mapping (Power Map)
•	Data Format: CSV, XLSX
